Watch for impatience:
	Art phase and menus phase sort of made me impatient to get something working
	because I had never done menus/art for a game. I wanted to get something
	going and working really quickly. It's one of the most poorly understood
	parts of my project now because of this.
	
Game organization is huge and the more you can learn about structuring large
scale projects the better. This game works well and is organized okay for a
beginner. It's relatively modular. But it's beginning to have a few things slip
in there that are hardcoded or not as flexible as they could be. This is also
likely related to impatience. 
	
I lack some of the skills I need still with the physics engine, player movement,
basics etc. also skills for polishing games. Tweens are fine, but the animation
player/creator, particle effects, etc. I am not so familiar with 

The lack of animations and juiciness is this games biggest issue at the moment.
Menus could stand to be redone.

Lack of settings is an issue. Specifically the screen resolution being tied to
1080p exclusively.
	
Menus are a mess

I don't understand custom resources

I don't understand Themes

Polish is so important and helps a game shine. 

You can do so much with gray boxing a game and if you stay in that phase for a
long time it's not necessarily a bad thing. Placeholder art is always a good
option too.

Deadlines are useful, but they aren't necessarily fun. I got a lot done and I
pushed myself to do more probably because of the deadlines, but it didn't 
enhance my enjoyment of the process.

Game design documents are important and mine was helpful in keeping me on track.
Simple tracking tools were also useful and important to the process (only used
a GDD, Trello, and Git for version control/issue logging).

It's impossible to really know when a game is done. Art is never finished, just
merely abandonned is a good quote.

You can accomplish a lot in 1 hr a day, but it will limit your scope
significantly if you want to regularly release anything substantive.

In the end I am having trouble being proud of the finished result even though it
is just my first game and I should be proud that I even made it this far! I am
not feeling that yet though. I think it's just a difficult time to focus on
things like this.
