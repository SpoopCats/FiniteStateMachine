screen horizontal = 360px
(-32 for ralph + pedestal) * 2 = 64
360 - 64 = 296px of playable cat lanes


296 / 32 = 9.25


Can have 9 lanes w/ 8 pixels to play with (the 0.25 above)

=== === ===

Do objects rubbing cause collisions or simply pass by?
If rubbing is an issue, Ralph will need more space... 
The 8 pixels to play with could give Ralph 4 pixels of space from the cats as they
pass by on either side of the screen

=== === ===

IF PB RALPH HAS 4 PIXELS OF SPACE

We get 9 separatelanes total
height of this area = 9*32 = 288px
width of view port = 1920

=== === ===

WHAT ARE MY CORNER COORDINATES?
LEFTTOP = Vector2(0, 36)
LEFTBTM = Vector2(0, 324)

RIGHTTOP = Vector2(1920, 36)
RIGHTBTM = Vector2(1920, 324)

THINGS NEED TO SPAWN OUTSIDE THIS SPACE!
ONCE THE CATS ARE INSIDE THE SCREEN THEY ARE JUST MOVING.

=== === ===

LEFT SIDE SPAWN POINTS
* dont be afraid to move more - in the X, this has 0 wiggle room right now and cats will
spawn 1 pixel off screen
-16, 52
-16, 84
-16, 116
-16, 148
-16, 180
-16, 212
-16, 244
-16, 276
-16, 308

RIGHT SIDE SPAWN POINTS
1936, 52
1936, 84
1936, 116
1936, 148
1936, 180
1936, 212
1936, 244
1936, 276
1936, 308

Each spawn point essentially has a 'twin' on the opposite side. If I only want
one cat in the lane at once, it's twin has to be removed at the same time.

=== === === 

LANE PICKING

- Can pick from an array (or similar data struc), remove that spawn point 
(and possibly it's left or right side twin) from the array.
- let the animations etc. play out.
- queue free the cat in the lane
- add lane (and twin) back into possible selection pool

DIFFICULTY LEVERS

What increases difficulty?

"When the spawner is more sophistocated, the game gets harder"

1. Time-between-spawns: timer that will determine when the next spawn occurs
2. >1 cat per lane: as difficulty increases, could include more than 1 cat per lane
3. Speed of cats: could increase the longer the player survives
4. Cats of varying speed: harder to judge when to go when obj move dif speed
4. Size of cats: larger would be harder to dodge

What decreases difficulty?
"When the player gets more sophistocated, the game gets a repreive in difficulty"

1. Ralph speed up
2. Ralph can take hits
3. Ralph can hit the cats and make them disappear for points
4. Ralph clears the screen of cats (watch out for this, because it will stop your
spawner lanes possibly if their lane never gets put back in the array!)
* these all boil down to speed up for Ralph or a powerup

=== === ===

HOW ARE CATS INSTANTIATED?
WHAT IS THE OVERALL FLOW OF THE SPAWNER FROM START TO FINISH?

My current thining is an Enemy_Manager.tscn could handle everything.
It can take an array of PackedScenes that have all the enemys in the game?
Here is documentation on exporting array variables:
